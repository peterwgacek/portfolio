                        Through my education as a software engineer and experience as a project manager in a high pressure industry, I understand how to execute multiple projects and manage people while meeting expectations in a time-sensitive environment. I am most energized working alongside passionate and driven individuals who work synergistic-ally to deliver an aggregate that is stronger than its components.</p>
                    <p className="about-text">
                        If you couldn't tell from my page, I'm a nerd of many colors and one of my many passions outside of programming and design is sequential art. In my personal time I write about and review comics on my bookstagram. You can follow along at:
